## 🧩 Overview
The **NSBE Internship Tracker** is a lightweight, front-end web application designed to help students in the UTSA NSBE Chapter efficiently **view, filter, and organize internship opportunities** shared by the chapter each week.

The tracker automates what used to be a manual Google Sheet process by reading internship data from a CSV file and dynamically displaying it on a responsive website.  
Students can instantly see which roles are *new*, *open*, *closing soon*, or *recently closed*.
